=================================================

 * to build run sh autogen.sh and then use ./configure and make
 * data/webmailers.ini has the meta data for supported webmailers
 * currently there is no way to add more webmailers, e.g. in user config
 * current used webmailer is saved on a per-user base; in
   $HOME/.config/desktop-webmail.ini
 * we require glib and gtk+ atm.
 * we assume xdg-open does the right thing and also rely on it being
   on the system
